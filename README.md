Calculation of convection heat transfer coefficients of monophasic flow

This is a series of C++ files to facilitate the calculation of Convection Heat Transfer Coefficient (h) in monophasic flow
Water and Air properties would be included in a class called "Fluid", soon more fluids will be included
